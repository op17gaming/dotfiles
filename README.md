# Dotfiles

**This contains the config files for my arch linux setup!
I would really love to let you use it as you will. fork it. learn from it. use it as inspiration. let your mind go wild!**

*************************************************************************************************************************

**On an (optional) fresh arch installation (archinstall or archfi will work too),
install the following packages as listed below (some are optional!).
if you're on an existing installation, make sure your files are backed up :D**

- `yay` (what I used to install these packages)
- `i3-gaps`
- `rofi`
- `polybar`
- `jonaburg-picom`
- `archlinux-logout`
- `dunst` (notification daemon)
- `zsh`
- `oh-my-zsh` (install from ohmyzsh's website)
- `xfce4-terminal` (optional)
- `networkmanager` (for network applet)
- `ttf-comfortaa` (optional, but is used in my configs)
- `terminus-font` (also optional, but it's used in my configs)
- `thunar` (for file management but is optional) (make sure its dependencies like `thunar-volman` is installed)
- `nitrogen`
- `lightdm` (optional, but that's what I use to log in with)
- (no lockscreen yet) (tell me if i missed keybindings)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Keybindings:**

* Launch xfce4-terminal:    `Mod + Enter`
* Launch rofi:              `Mod + D`
* Launch thunar:            `Mod + Shift + E`
* Launch archlinux-logout:  `Mod + X`
* Launch xfce4-taskmanager: `Control + Shift + Escape`
* Reload i3 config:         `Mod + Shift + R`

**Note: most other keybindings should be the same as stock i3, except i dont use hjkl, instead I use the arrow keys. Also, for some reason, split horizontal and split vertical was swapped. now its: split horizontal = `Mod + H` and split vertical `Mod + V`. if i missed a few keybindings i didnt list, check i3-gaps's config file provided (info should be given about what does what).**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**To Do:**

+ add a function to 'volume' in polybar so that it opens pavucontrol with right click
+ add a function to the wifi interface text so that it opens the networkmanager applet on left click

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Additional Info:**

- I am by no means the owner of the two wallpapers. those two wallpapers provided are included in the `Dotfiles/Pictures/Wallpapers` so that when you `git clone` my repo or download it, you can just drag all the files & folders from the `Dotfiles` root directory into your home directory (if you wish to do so).
- the file `wallpaperflare.com_wallpaper(1).jpg` is the current wallpaper I chose.
- the previous wallpaper `893622-OutRun-Retrowave-synthwave-purple-purple-background.png` was almost the wallpaper since i kinda liked it, but found it to be too bright.
- *additional additional info here soon :)*

**Here's some screenshots to show what it should look like after:**
