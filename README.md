# Dotfiles

This contains the config files for my arch linux setup!

The following packages are required:
- `i3-gaps`
- `rofi`
- `polybar`
- `jonaburg-picom`
- `archlinux-logout`
- `dunst` (notification daemon)
- `zsh`
- `oh-my-zsh` (install from ohmyzsh's website)
- `xfce4-terminal` (optional)
- `networkmanager` (for network applet)
- `ttf-comfortaa` (optional, but is used in my configs)
- `terminus-font` (also optional, but it's used in my configs)
- `thunar` (for file management but is optional) (make sure its dependencies like `thunar-volman` is installed)

Here's some screenshots to show what it should look like after:
